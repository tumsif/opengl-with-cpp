# OpenGl
Is an api for creating 2D and 3D graphic images

Opengl specifies a set of commands in which each command directs a drawing action or causes special effects

It is independent of windowing characteristics of each operating system

## Setup
- working with fedora when the `<GL/glut>` header is not found download the package freeglut-devel.
- when compiling the source file to excecutable it is very important to include the package that was used eg. `g++ main.cpp -o main -lGL -lGLU -lglut` then excecute by running `./main`
